    "Our aim was to develop a computational model to precisely and accurately characterize the trajectory of a rocket subject to aerodynamic loads and nonlinear forces. This was done by implementing experimental variables in the computational model such that its predictions, along with experimental measurements, pass a Chi-Squared Test. The goals of our project were as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain thrust-curve data for an Estes A8 Motor\n",
    "- Generate experimental data (apex height, time of flight, and lateral distance traveled) by launching rockets in variable environments\n",
    "- Prove/improve an Runge-Kuta 4 (RK4) computational model of a rocket in an aerodynamic environment. Variables of time-dependent wind speed and direction, air temperature, thrust, air drag, and launch angle are included\n",
    "- Estimate Uncertainty using Monte Carlo algorithms and numerical integrators\n",
    "- Compare characteristics of rocket performance with those of the simulations using a Chi-Squared Test ($\\alpha$ = .05)\n",
    "\n",
    "We predicted a passing p-value ($\\alpha$ > .05), suggesting no significant difference between results from our computational model and results from our experiment. We made the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Air resistance follows the quadratic air drag model\n",
    "$$  F_{drag} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 C A $$\n",
    "- Air density is not constant and is well-approximated by NASA's Troposphere model:\n",

    "- The area surrounding ground-zero has no height variability. That is, the rocket lands at the same elevation it launched.\n",
    "- The shape of the rocket is constant and is a cylindrically shaped with a cone - shaped tip.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "Before the launch, we ran static tests to gather thrust data using a force sensor. The setup had the force sensor on the ground, a wood block on top, and the rocket motor mounted on the block. We used stands on either side to stop the block from tipping over. This allowed us to collect our own thrust-curve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the launch, we used a flat, open area, we started with the fields above the temple and eventually decided to go to the sand dunes to make it easy to track the rocket. The launch pad set up pointing straight up. Motors were prepped with igniters and plugs to hold them in place. Since about one-third of the igniters didn’t work the first time, we thankfully brought extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure apex height, we used an Estes Altitrak, placed at two distances, 30 m and 50 m from the launch site the first two launches and 40 m away on the third launch, measured using a surveyor’s wheel. Wind speed and gusts as well as temperature were intented to be recorded each launch day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We collected the thrust curve data using a laptop running Logger Pro then fit it to a graph, and predicted the rockets behavior using Python 3.13. Phones were used to time the flights and record videos for later review. Environmental conditions like temperature and wind were logged for each trial so they could be used as inputs for the simulation and in Chi-Squared comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "### Thrust Curve Data Collection\n",
    "1. Placed the force sensor on the ground with a wooden block resting on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mounted an Estes A8 motor vertically on the block, aligning it with the force sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Secured the block using side stands to prevent it from tipping over during ignition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inserted igniter into the motor, using a plug to keep it in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Connected the force sensor to Logger Pro and began data recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Used launcher to attempt to ignite the motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. When it ignited we had Logger Pro captured the force over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Repeated the process as needed for multiple trials to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rocket Launch & Flight Measurements\n",
    "1. Chose a flat, open launch area with good visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up the launch pad.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Measured and marked two observation points at at set distances from the launch pad using a surveyor’s wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Positioned an Estes Altitrak (with a person)  at each distance for angular measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recorded wind speed and gust conditions using an anemometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Prepared the rocket by installing a motor and inserting the igniter with a plug.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Confirmed igniter wires not touching under plug and that the igniter had continuity, then launched the rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Timed the flight using video.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Measured the angle to the rocket's apex from both set distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Retrieved rockets after landing, checked and attempted to fix damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Repeated launches under different weather conditions and recorded all data (angle to find vertical distance, time of flight, horizonal distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following thrust-curve data was recorded for an Estes A8 Motor:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Thrust_Curve_Data.png](attachment:Thrust_Curve_Data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first day of recording had the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3 mph average wind speed (1.3 m/s) $\\pm$ 10% from SSW\n",
    "- 7 mph gusts (3.1 m/s) $\\pm$ 10% from SSW\n",
    "- 7 $\\pm$ 2 Degrees Celsius\n",
    "- Horizontal Distances Traveled (Trials 2 - 6) in m: 2, 6, 15, 12, 9 $\\pm$ 1\n",
    "- Apex Angle measurements from 30 $\\pm$ 1 m: 59, 56, 62, 55, 63, 54 $\\pm$ 2 degrees\n",
    "- Apex Angle measurements from 50 $\\pm$ 1 m: 39, 48, 30, 50, 42, 40 $\\pm$ 2 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wind issues\n",
    "* Gusts reached 11 meters per second, making control difficult.\n",
    "    * Launched a C6-5 motor rocket expected to reach 300 meters in wind—never found it.\n",
    "#### Cold and muddy terrain\n",
    "* Leftover snow left on cardboard rocket, weakening the structure.\n",
    "    * Had to cut away soggy cardboard to fit the motor.\n",
    "* Searching for lost rockets meant walking through five inches of mud sometimes.\n",
    "    * Decided to launch at the sand dunes instead.\n",
    "#### Parachute failures\n",
    "* Initially didn’t deploy—packed too tight. We pulled the parachute long ways then folded it.\n",
    "    * Unfolded parachute, this helped, but parachutes got tangled and didn’t unravel.\n",
    "        * Finally stretched the strings around the parachute in its correct orientation while packed.\n",
    "* Parachute had creases and would not unfold.\n",
    "* 2/3 success rate—some rockets still crashed.\n",
    "    * 2 rockets bent upon landing after falling on road.\n",
    "#### Nose cone connection issues\n",
    "* 80% failure rate with original cardstock, Elmers glue and staple method.\n",
    "    * Switched to cutting a hole in the rocket, threading the rubber band through, and securing it with superglue—better results.\n",
    "#### Launcher problems\n",
    "* Bad batteries and faulty bulb.\n",
    "    * Fixed by replacing parts.\n",
    "* Launcher wire disconnected from clamp and insulation was broken away causing a short circuit.\n",
    "    * Soldered wires back together with heat shrink covering them\n",
    "#### Igniter\n",
    "* 1/3 of igniters failed to work on the first attempt.\n",
    "    * Retried with multiple igniters after confirming that the igniter wires weren't touching where they shouldn't be.\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous setbacks\n",
    "* GitHub confusion—team lacked experience.\n",
    "* Didn’t know the plug was needed to hold the igniter.\n",
    "* Angle finder maxed out, making altitude data useless for C6-5 motors.\n",
    "* Forgot the rolling meter stick.\n",
    "* Melted the end of a rocket.\n",

    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple trigonometry was used to calculate the apex height and it's uncertainty. Using the angle to the apex, and the horizontal distance, the height becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = d\\;\\text{tan}(\\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta y = \\sqrt{\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta}\\delta \\theta\\bigg)^2 + \\bigg(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial d}\\delta d\\bigg)^2}$$\n",

    "$$\\delta y = \\sqrt{\\bigg(d \\;\\text{sec}^2(\\theta) \\;\\delta \\theta   \\bigg)^2 + \\bigg(\\text{tan}(\\theta)\\;\\delta d\\bigg)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the heights of the two datasets was done with the following relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\frac{x_1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{x_2}{\\sigma_2^2}}{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2}}} $$\n",
