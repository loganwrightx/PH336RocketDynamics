    "## Introduction\n",

    "Our aim was to develop a computational model to precisely and accurately characterize the trajectory of a rocket subject to aerodynamic loads and nonlinear forces. This was done by implementing experimental variables in the computational model such that its predictions, along with experimental measurements, pass a Chi-Squared Test. The goals of our project were as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain thrust-curve data for an Estes A8 Motor\n",
    "- Generate experimental data (apex height, time of flight, and lateral distance traveled) by launching rockets in variable environments\n",
    "- Prove/improve an Runge-Kuta 4 (RK4) computational model of a rocket in an aerodynamic environment. Variables of time-dependent wind speed and direction, air temperature, thrust, air drag, and launch angle are included\n",
    "- Estimate Uncertainty using Monte Carlo algorithms and numerical integrators\n",
    "- Compare characteristics of rocket performance with those of the simulations using a Chi-Squared Test ($\\alpha$ = .05)\n",
    "\n",
    "We predicted a passing p-value ($\\alpha$ > .05), suggesting no significant difference between results from our computational model and results from our experiment. We made the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Air resistance follows the quadratic air drag model\n",
    "$$  F_{drag} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 C A $$\n",
    "- Air density is not constant and is well-approximated by NASA's Troposphere model:\n",

    "$$ t = 15.04 - .00649 \\; h$$\n",
    "$$ p = 101.29 \\cdot \\frac{t}{288.08} ^ {5.256} $$\n",
    "$$ \\rho = \\frac{p}{.2869 \\cdot t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The area surrounding ground-zero has no height variability. That is, the rocket lands at the same elevation it launched.\n",
    "- The shape of the rocket is constant and is a cylindrically shaped with a cone - shaped tip.\n",
