    "\n",
    "- Soldering iron and solder\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "Before the launch, we ran static tests to gather thrust data using a force sensor. The setup had the force sensor on the ground, a wood block on top, and the rocket motor mounted on the block. We used stands on either side to stop the block from tipping over. This allowed us to collect our own thrust-curve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the launch, we used a flat, open area, we started with the fields above the temple and eventually decided to go to the sand dunes to make it easy to track the rocket. The launch pad set up pointing straight up. Motors were prepped with igniters and plugs to hold them in place. Since about one-third of the igniters didn’t work the first time, we thankfully brought extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure apogee, we used an Estes Altitrak, placed at two distances, 30 m and 50 m from the launch site the first two launches and 40 m away on the third launch, measured using a surveyor’s wheel. Wind speed and gusts as well as temperature were intented to be recorded each launch day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We collected the thrust curve data using a laptop running Logger Pro then fit it to a graph, and predicted the rockets behavior using Python 3.13. Phones were used to time the flights and record videos for later review. Environmental conditions like temperature and wind were logged for each trial so they could be used as inputs for the simulation and in Chi-Squared comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "### Thrust Curve Data Collection\n",
    "1. Placed the force sensor on the ground with a wooden block resting on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mounted an Estes A8 motor vertically on the block, aligning it with the force sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Secured the block using side stands to prevent it from tipping over during ignition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inserted igniter into the motor, using a plug to keep it in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Connected the force sensor to Logger Pro and began data recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Used launcher to attempt to ignite the motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. When it ignited we had Logger Pro captured the force over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Repeated the process as needed for multiple trials to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rocket Launch & Flight Measurements\n",
    "1. Chose a flat, open launch area with good visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up the launch pad.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Measured and marked two observation points at at set distances from the launch pad using a surveyor’s wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Positioned an Estes Altitrak (with a person)  at each distance for angular measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recorded wind speed and gust conditions using an anemometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Prepared the rocket by installing a motor and inserting the igniter with a plug.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Confirmed igniter wires not touching under plug and that the igniter had continuity, then launched the rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Timed the flight using video.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Measured the angle to the rocket's apex from both set distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Retrieved rockets after landing, checked and attempted to fix damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Repeated launches under different weather conditions and recorded all data (angle to find vertical distance, time of flight, horizonal distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following thrust-curve data was recorded for an Estes A8 Motor:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Experimental difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wind issues\n",
    "* Gusts reached 11 meters per second, making control difficult.\n",

    "#### Parachute failures\n",
    "* Initially didn’t deploy—packed too tight. We pulled the parachute long ways then folded it.\n",
    "    * Unfolded parachute, this helped, but parachutes got tangled and didn’t unravel.\n",
    "        * Finally stretched the strings around the parachute in its correct orientation while packed.\n",
    "* Parachute had creases and would not unfold.\n",
    "* 2/3 success rate—some rockets still crashed.\n",
    "    * 2 rockets bent upon landing after falling on road.\n",
    "#### Nose cone connection issues\n",
    "* 80% failure rate with original cardstock, Elmers glue and staple method.\n",
    "    * Switched to cutting a hole in the rocket, threading the rubber band through, and securing it with superglue—better results.\n",
    "#### Launcher problems\n",
    "* Bad batteries and faulty bulb.\n",
    "    * Fixed by replacing parts.\n",
    "* Launcher wire disconnected from clamp and insulation was broken away causing a short circuit.\n",
    "    * Soldered wires back together with heat shrink covering them\n",
    "#### Igniter\n",
    "* 1/3 of igniters failed to work on the first attempt.\n",
    "    * Retried with multiple igniters after confirming that the igniter wires weren't touching where they shouldn't be.\n",
    "#### Miscellaneous setbacks\n",
    "* GitHub confusion—team lacked experience.\n",
    "* Didn’t know the plug was needed to hold the igniter.\n",
    "* Angle finder maxed out, making altitude data useless for C6-5 motors.\n",
    "* Forgot the rolling meter stick.\n",
    "* Melted the end of a rocket.\n",

    "# Rocket Trajectory Characterization Using Experimental Data and Computational Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim was to develop a computational model to precisely and accurately characterize the trajectory of a rocket subject to aerodynamic loads and nonlinear forces. This was done by implementing experimental variables in the computational model such that its predictions, along with experimental measurements, pass a Chi-Squared Test. The goals of our project were to obtain thrust-curve data for an Estes A8 Motor, generate experimental data such as apogee, time of flight, and lateral distance traveled by launching rockets in variable environments, and to prove or improve a Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) computational model of a rocket in an aerodynamic environment. This model incorporated variables such as time-dependent wind speed and direction, air temperature, thrust, air drag, and launch angle. We also aimed to estimate uncertainty using Monte Carlo algorithms and numerical integrators, and compare characteristics of rocket performance with those of the simulations using a Chi-Squared Test with significance level $ \\alpha = 0.05 $. We predicted a passing p-value ($ \\alpha > 0.05 $), which would suggest no significant difference between the results from our computational model and the results from our experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We made several assumptions in our modeling. Air resistance was assumed to follow the quadratic air drag model:\n",

    "$\\rho$ = air density (kg/m³),  \n",
    "$v$ = velocity of the rocket (m/s),  \n",
    "$C$ = drag coefficient (unitless),  \n",
    "$A$ = cross-sectional area of the rocket (m²).\n",
    "\n",
    "Air density was assumed to vary with altitude and was modeled using NASA’s Troposphere equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = 15.04 - 0.00649h\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = 101.29 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{t}{288.08} \\right)^{5.256}\n",

    "\n",
    "We also assumed the launch and landing elevations were the same, implying zero height variability in the surrounding terrain. The rocket was modeled with a constant shape—cylindrical with a conical tip—and constant mass throughout the flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "The equipment used included multiple Estes A8 and C6 motors, an Estes SkyWriter rocket with a nosecone and parachute, and standard launch supplies such as a launch pad, launcher, igniters, and motor wadding. A computer with Python 3.13 and Logger Pro was used to collect and analyze data. A phone was used for video timing and recording. We used a force sensor to record thrust during static testing, as well as a thermometer and anemometer to record environmental conditions. An Estes Altitrak was used to measure apogee from the ground, with distances verified using a surveyor’s wheel. Additional supplies included rubber bands, tape, a wood block for motor mounting, stationary stands, lab notebooks, pens, a soldering iron, and solder for repairing electrical components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any launches, we conducted static thrust tests to collect our own thrust-curve data. We placed the force sensor on the ground, positioned a wood block on top, and mounted the rocket motor vertically on the block. Stands were used on either side to prevent tipping. The igniter was inserted into the motor and secured with a plug. Logger Pro was used to record force data during ignition. For launch testing, we initially used fields above a temple but later relocated to sand dunes for easier tracking. The launch pad was positioned vertically. Igniters were placed and secured with plugs, and backups were prepared due to a high first-failure rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure apogee, we used an Estes Altitrak operated from multiple distances: 30 meters and 50 meters for the first two launches, and 40 meters on the third launch. Distances were measured with a surveyor’s wheel. Wind speed and gusts were recorded using an anemometer, and temperature was measured each day. Logger Pro captured thrust data, which was then graphed and used in a Python 3.13 simulation of rocket behavior. Video was used to time flights, and all recorded conditions were included in our modeling and statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "The project began by finding the thrust curve of the motors, to do this the force sensor was placed on the ground with a wooden block resting on top. An Estes A8 motor was then mounted vertically on the block, inside a drilled shallow hole, aligning the motor with the force sensor. The block was secured using stands to prevent it from tipping over during ignition. An igniter was inserted into the motor using a plug to keep it in place. The force sensor was connected to Logger Pro and data recording began. A launcher was used to attempt to ignite the motor. When it ignited, Logger Pro captured the force over time. This process was repeated multiple times with the hope of ensuring consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the project was the launch. After choosing a flat, open launch area with good visibility the launch pad was set up. Using a surveyor's wheel, two observation points were measured out from the launch pad. An Estes Altitrak was then used at each of these points. The wind speed was recorded using an anemometer. Multiple pieces of wadding were placed into the top of the rocket, the parachute was pushed down onto the wadding and the nosecone was placed on top. A motor was installed into the rocket and an igniter was installed into the motor using a plug to hold it in place. It was confirmed that the igniter wires were not touching under the plug and that the igniter had continuity. The rocket was slid down onto the launch pad and the launcher was attached to each side of the igniter. The rocket was launched. The flight was recorded and the video was used to time the flight. From the two observation points, the angle to the rocket's apex was measured. The rocket was retrieved and damage was assessed. The data was recorded. The process was repeated under different weather conditions until consistency was achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The following thrust-curve data was recorded for an Estes A8 Motor:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Thrust_Curve_Data.png](Thrust_Curve_Data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first test day, average wind speed was 3 mph (1.3 m/s) ±10% from the south-southwest, with gusts reaching 7 mph (3.1 m/s) ±10%. The temperature was $7 \\pm 2 ^\\circ\\text{C}$. Horizontal distances for trials 2 through 6 were 2, 6, 15, 12, and 9 meters ±1. Apogee angle measurements from 30 ±1 meters were 59°, 56°, 62°, 55°, 63°, and 54° ±2°. From 50 ±1 meters, angles were 39°, 48°, 30°, 50°, 42°, and 40° ±2°.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind conditions were a major challenge, with gusts reaching 11 m/s and contributing to the loss of a C6-5 rocket. Cold and muddy terrain added to the challenge as the snow soaked into the cardboard rockets, requiring trimming to fit the motors. These challenges prompted us to relocate to sand dunes. Parachute deployment issues persisted throughout early launches. Parachutes were initially packed too tightly and did not unfold. We tried unfolding and refolding techniques, eventually not even wrapping the strings around the parachute which slightly improved results. We achieved about a two-thirds success rate, but some rockets still crashed, and two were damaged after landing on hard surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nose cone connections failed frequently using cardstock, glue, and staples, with about a four-fifths failure rate. We later switched to threading a rubber band through a hole in the body and using superglue, which was more reliable. The launcher itself also had problems, including bad batteries, a faulty bulb, and disconnected wires, which caused short circuits. These were resolved with part replacements, soldering, and heat shrink. Igniter failure was also common, with around one-third failing on the first attempt. After confirming wires were not touching improperly, we reattempted launches using backup igniters. Other issues included GitHub confusion, not knowing the plug was needed to secure igniters, the angle finder maxing out (rendering C6-5 altitude data unusable), a forgotten rolling meter stick, and a rocket tip that melted during launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We used basic trigonometry to calculate apogee. Using the angle to the apex and the horizontal distance, the height was given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = d \\cdot \\tan(\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$y$ = apogee (m),  \n",
    "$d$ = horizontal distance from observer to launch point (m),  \n",
    "$\\theta$ = measured angle of elevation to the rocket at its apex (radians or degrees, consistent with calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty in the height measurement was calculated via propagation of error:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta y = \\sqrt{ \\left( d \\cdot \\sec^2(\\theta) \\cdot \\delta\\theta \\right)^2 + \\left( \\tan(\\theta) \\cdot \\delta d \\right)^2 }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$\\delta y$ = uncertainty in height (m),  \n",
    "$\\delta \\theta$ = uncertainty in the angle (radians),  \n",
    "$\\delta d$ = uncertainty in horizontal distance (m).\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine apogee results from multiple measurements with different uncertainties, we used a weighted average:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{ \\frac{x_1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{x_2}{\\sigma_2^2} }{ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2} }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2} } }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$\\bar{x}$ = combined best estimate for height (m),  \n",
    "$x_1, x_2$ = individual height measurements (m),  \n",
    "$\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ = corresponding uncertainties (m),  \n",
    "$\\sigma$ = uncertainty of the combined height estimate (m).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first launch day yielded the following experimental results. The total height reached was $47 \\pm 6$ meters. Total hang time was $7.2 \\pm 0.8$ seconds. The horizontal distance traveled was $9 \\pm 4$ meters.\n",
